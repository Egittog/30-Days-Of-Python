Note to myself (Gina)

When you fork a project on GitHub, you create a personal copy of the original repository under your GitHub account. Here’s how edits work:

Visibility of Your Edits
Personal Fork: Any changes you make to your forked repository are initially only visible to you and anyone who has access to your fork (e.g., collaborators you add).

Pull Requests: If you want to share your changes with the original repository, you can create a pull request. The maintainers of the original project can then review your changes and decide whether to merge them.

Public Fork: If your forked repository is public, others can view your changes by navigating to your fork on GitHub. They won’t see your edits unless they specifically look at your forked repository.

When you add a file to your forked GitHub repository, you can choose between two options for committing your changes:

1. Direct Commit
Commit Directly to the main Branch: This option will add your changes directly to the main branch of your forked repository.
Use When: You are confident in your changes and don’t need to test them separately or get a review.
Effect: Your changes become part of the main branch of your fork immediately. You can later create a pull request from your fork’s main branch to the original repository if you want to propose your changes there.
2. Create a New Branch and Pull Request (PR)
Create a New Branch for This Commit and Start a Pull Request: This option creates a new branch for your changes and initiates a pull request.
Use When: You want to keep your changes isolated for testing, or you plan to propose your changes to the original repository and want them reviewed first.
Effect: A new branch is created in your fork. You can work on this branch independently and create a pull request to merge it into your main branch or into the original repository.
